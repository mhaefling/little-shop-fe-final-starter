### Context:
Added the coupons to the coupon view section, so that you can view the coupons of each Merchant.

### Learning Goals:
Learn how to work with the frontend and requesting API data so that you can display it on the front end.


### Wins + Challenges:
My backend is structured so that each coupon has a dollar_off attribute and a percent _off attribute.
Creating the conditional to only display the one that contains a value was a win.
